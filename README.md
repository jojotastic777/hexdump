# Hexdump

Hexdump is an addon for Hex Casting which adds a command, `/hexdump`, which writes all non-per-world patterns
from every installed addon into a `patterns.json` file in your `.minecraft` folder.

If you want to include per-world patterns such as Great Spells, you need to use an op-only subcommand:
`/hexdump with-per-world`.
